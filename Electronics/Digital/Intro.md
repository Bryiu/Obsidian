- Divide into two area's
	- Analog

# History

- Electronics of counting
- Abacus was the first digital counting device
- 17th century, Pascal invented a mechanical counting machine
- 19th century, Babbage made a counting machine with a programmed controller
- 1940, ENIAC was invented, the first electronic general-purpose digital computer
	- Used large vacuum tubes that were big, expensive, unreliable
	- Second generation replaced the vacuum tube with the transistor
	- Third generation combined the transistor with the Integrated Circuit

# Intro

- Digital circuit schematics have square box's instead of components
- Only react to two input signals or voltage levels, high and low
	- Square or pulse
	- Form logic functions
		- And; Or; Not

## Logic functions
