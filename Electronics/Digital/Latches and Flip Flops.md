# Intro to Latches and Flip Flops

## Sequential Circuits

- Digital circuits can be classified in two catagories
	- Combinational
		- produce outputs only when an input is applied
	- Sequential
		- will retain the output after the input is removed
		- feedback line allows the gate to remember its previous output
			- Latches an input to the output

- Latches and flip flops are both used as memory devices
	- Both are bistable

## Latch

- changes states when inputs are changed

- Active high RS Latch
	- **![[Pasted image 20240216192529.png]] 
- Active Low RS Latch
	- ![[Pasted image 20240216192736.png]] 
- Latches can have the same outputs, this can cause problems


## Flip Flop

- Constructed of many gates and there are several gate configs used to create storage flip flops

- Flip flops are almost never drawn out as a logic diagram.
	- They are represented by a logic symbol with the labeled inputs and outputs defining their type
	- Flip flops contain a clock circuit
- Latches an flip flops are used extensively in digital circuits in the form of registers, counters, and memory circuits
