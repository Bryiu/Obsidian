# Intro to Latches and Flip Flops

## Sequential Circuits

- Digital circuits can be classified in two catagories
	- Combinational
		- produce outputs only when an input is applied
	- Sequential
		- will retain the output after the input is removed
		- feedback line allows the gate to remember its previous output
			- Latches an input to the output

- Latches and flip flops are both used as memory devices
	- Both are bistable

## Latch

- changes states when inputs are changed
