	- Analog signals must be converted to digital before digital circuits can process them


## Conversion Circuits

	- A/D converters changes analog signals to digital signals
	- D/A converters change digital signals to analog signals

### A/D Converters

#### Simultaneous A/D Converter

- ![[Pasted image 20240308114434.png]] 
	- This is a simultaneous A/D converter circuit
		- *aka Flash Converter*
	- Compares the analog input voltage with a reference voltage produced $R_1-R_4$ 
	- When the analog voltage exceeds the reference voltage for a given comparator, a HIGH is given
		- ![[Pasted image 20240308120035.png]] 
	- The High or lows are applied to the Encoder
		- Produces a two-digit binary number on every sampling pulse input
			- Sampling pulse is generated by the digital controller for the overall analog to digital process
	- The output of the Encoder represents the digital equivalent of the analog input
	- ![[Pasted image 20240308120730.png]] 
		- The analog sine wave produces a digital square wave represented in binary numbers
	- Advantage of 'this type' of A/D converter is that the analog input is converted to digital simultaneously 
	- A separate comparator is needed for each level of quantization. 

#### Ramp Converter

- ![[Pasted image 20240308132733.png]] 
	- Stair step converter or Ramp converter
	- If the analog input voltage is higher than the output of the D/A converter, a high output is generated by the comparator
	- The AND gate is enabled, allowing the clock pulses to be applied to the up counter.
	- As long as the comparator output is HIGH, the up counter will continue counting up through the eight steps
		- Causes 000 to 111 to appear at the outputs
	- The analog output will be at 1 of 8 analog levels
	- The Up counter continues counting upwards until the comparator output goes low
		- Stops the Up counter as the D/A converter output is above the analog input
		- After 8 clock pulses, the Up counter receives a clear signal that resets the Up Counter to 000
	- Analog sine wave input produces a stepped digital output
		- ![[Pasted image 20240308141744.png]] 
	- Advantage: it has fewer components to a simultaneous A/D converter
	- Disadvantage: Slower analog sample rate
		- Can only be sampled once every 8 clock pulses

#### Tracking A/D Converter

- ![[Pasted image 20240308142800.png]] 
	- Operates like a Ramp Converter, but counts up and down
	- The counter has four outputs providing 16 output levels from 0000 to 1111 (higher resolution output)
	- A comparator High causes the counter to count up with each clock pulse
	- A comparator low causes the counter to count down with each clock pulse
	- Tracks an analog input with each clock pulse
- Advantage: Fast conversion

## D/A Converters

### Binary Weighted 

- ![[Pasted image 20240308152123.png]] 
	- Resolution of 16
	- QA is LSD
	- QD is MSD
	- Analog voltage output is taken from a 'multimeter' across $R_{out}$ 
		- The output is usually applied to an Op-Amp for amplification and isolation
		- Output voltage depends on the register digital output
			- Sum of the four currents
			- LSD has the highest resistance
				- Least amount of voltage drop across $R_{out}$
			- Each 16 output combinations from the register produces a different voltage across $R_{out}$ 
- Advantage: Simultaneous
- Disadvantage: More components

### R/2R D/A converter

- ![[Pasted image 20240308173509.png]] 
	- Aka Ladder converter
	- Total resistance determines the analog voltage output
	- Advantage: Uses only two values of resistors

## Data circuits
### Data Selector

- ![[Pasted image 20240308191622.png]] 
	- Used to select a specific input when more than one input is applied


### Data Distributor

- ![[Pasted image 20240308191715.png]] 
	- Used to distribute one specific output when more than one output is available
