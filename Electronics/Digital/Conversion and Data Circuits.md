	- Analog signals must be converted to digital before digital circuits can process them


## Conversion Circuits

- ![[Pasted image 20240308113818.png]] 
	- A/D converters changes analog signals to digital signals
	- D/A converters change digital signals to analog signals

### A/D Converters

#### Simultaneous A/D Converter

- ![[Pasted image 20240308114434.png]] 
	- This is a simultaneous A/D converter circuit
		- *aka Flash Converter*
	- Compares the analog input voltage with a reference voltage produced $R_1-R_4$ 
	- When the analog voltage exceeds the reference voltage for a given comparator, a HIGH is given
		- ![[Pasted image 20240308120035.png]] 
	- The High or lows are applied to the Encoder
		- Produces a two-digit binary number on every sampling pulse input
			- Sampling pulse is generated by the digital controller for the overall analog to digital process
	- The output of the Encoder represents the digital equivalent of the analog input
	- ![[Pasted image 20240308120730.png]] 
		- The analog sine wave produces a digital square wave represented in binary numbers
	- Advantage of 'this type' of A/D converter is that the analog input is converted to digital simultaneously 
	- A separate comparator is needed for each level of quantization. 

#### Ramp Converter

- ![[Pasted image 20240308132733.png]] 
	- Stair step converter or Ramp converter
	- If the analog input voltage is higher than the output of the D/A converter, a high output is generated by the comparator
	- The AND gate is enabled, allowing the clock pulses to be applied to the up counter.
	- As long as the comparator output is HIGH, the up counter will continue counting up through the eight steps
		- Causes 000 to 111 to appear at the outputs
	- The analog output will be at 1 of 8 analog levels
	- The Up counter continues counting upwards until the comparator output goes low
		- Stops the Up counter as the D/A converter output is above the analog input
		- After 8 clock pulses, the Up counter receives a clear signal that resets the Up Counter to 000
	- Analog sine wave input produces a stepped digital output
		- ![[Pasted image 20240308141744.png]] 
	- Advantage: it has fewer components to a simultaneous A/D converter
	- Disadvantage: Slower analog sample rate
		- Can only be sampled once every 8 clock pulses

#### Tracking A/D Converter

- ![[Pasted image 20240308142800.png]] 
	- Operates like a Ramp Converter, but counts up and down
	- The counter has four outputs providing 16 output levels from 0000 to 1111 (higher resolution output)
	- A comparator High causes the counter to count up with each clock pulse
	- A comparator low causes the counter to count down with each clock pulse
	- Tracks an analog input with each clock pulse
- Advantage: Fast conversion

## D/A Converters

### Binary Weighted 

- ![[Pasted image 20240308152123.png]] 
	- Resolution of 16
	- QA is LSD
	- QD is MSD
	- Analog voltage output is taken from a 'multimeter' across $R_{out}$ 
		- The output is usually applied to an Op-Amp for amplification and isolation
		- Output voltage depends on the register digital output
			- Sum of the four currents
			- LSD has the highest resistance
				- Least amount of voltage drop across $R_{out}$
			- Each 16 output combinations from the register produces a different voltage across $R_{out}$ 
- Advantage: Simultaneous
- Disadvantage: More components

### R/2R D/A converter

- ![[Pasted image 20240308173509.png]] 
	- Aka Ladder converter
	- Total resistance determines the analog voltage output
	- Advantage: Uses only two values of resistors

## Data circuits
### Data Selector

- ![[Pasted image 20240309112115.png]] 
	- Used to select a specific input when more than one input is applied
	- A1 and A2 are used to select the data that is sent to the output
		- A1, A2 are 0's, goes to A
- **Multiplexing**: The process of putting information from several sources onto a single line or transmission path


### Data Distributor

- ![[Pasted image 20240309124224.png]] 
	- Used to distribute one specific output when more than one output is available
	- If A1 and A2 are 0 the input data is sent to A
- **Demultiplexing**: the process of pulling information from a multiplexed signal and directing it to several output paths

# D/A Conversion

- D/A converter circuits generate voltages to represent the binary column values

## Weighted

- ![[Pasted image 20240309154735.png]] 
	- Each binary digits value is represented by a resistor value
- ![[Pasted image 20240309154837.png]] 
	- Places a 0 volt potential at TP1 using an op amp
	- When a high is applied to input D, Current flows through resistor R
	- The current is the output of the op-amp through $R_{out}$ 
		- Does not flow from the inverting (-) input of the op amp due to the very high input inpedence
		- Current produced by R develops a voltage across $R_{out}$; the analog output voltage
			- The amount of voltage depends on the current generated by resistor R
				- R has the lowest resistance
					- Voltage produced by the High input of D generates the largest voltage output
	- Offset Voltage is subtracted from input voltage
		- value of 0000 


>[!Note]
>When finding the voltage for Rout; Find the current going through each resistor, then add, and multiply by the Rout value

## Scaled 

- ![[Pasted image 20240309171134.png]] 
- R/2R D/A converter
	- The smallest voltage generated is 1/16th of the input voltage
		- This is called the resolution voltage

# A/D Conversion


- Resolution is determined by the number of Digital output lines and the number of compared inputs to the encoder
	- Simultaneous converter has 3 comparator inputs
		- Provides 4 different linear input states
			- Will vary between 0 and 3
				- Vary between 00 and 11
	- Substituting a zener diode for R4 can preset a voltage range so that just a small percentage of the overall input is sampled
		- Encoder has 2 output lines to represent the input digitally
- Almost all measurable quantities are recorded in analog form
- A/D converters convert analog to digital
- ![[Pasted image 20240310100746.png]] 
- ![[Pasted image 20240310102520.png]] 
	- Simultaneous Converter
		- Separate comparator is needed for each level of quantization
	- Compares analog input voltage with reference voltage produced by R1-R4
	- When the analog voltage exceeds the reference voltage for a given comparator, a high is generated
		- The highs and low outputs of the comparators are applied to an encoder, which produces a two-bit binary number on every sampling pulse
	- The output of the encoder represents the digital equivalent of the analog input
	- The analog sine wave is output as a digital square wave represented in binary numbers
		- ![[Pasted image 20240310110650.png]] 
- ![[Pasted image 20240310112419.png]] 
	- Stair step or Ramp Converter
	- Analog input is compared with the output of the D/A converter
		- If input is higher than the output, the comparator generates a high output
			- As long as the comparator output is high, the up counter will continue counting up
		- When the counter contains a binary number equal to the analog input, the comparator output goes LOW
			- Holds the output of the and gate LOW
			- Stops the UP counter
			- Clock pulses ignored
	- CLR input sets the counter to zero before another conversion takes place
	- ![[Pasted image 20240310114434.png]] 
	- Advantage: Fewer components
	- Disadvantage: Slower
- ![[Pasted image 20240310114537.png]] 
	- Tracking Converter
		- Continuously tracks an analog input
	- Operates like a stair step, except the counter counts up and down
	- High on the comparator and the counter counts up
	- Low on the comparator and the counter counts down
	- Advantage: Fast conversion requiring less circuitry
- ![[Pasted image 20240310121931.png]] 
	- The greater the number, the higher the digital resolution
- ![[Pasted image 20240310123313.png]] 
	- Zener diode presets the first input to 12VDC 
	- Encoder digital output represents 12V-15V
	- Analog input below 12VDC produce a digital 00 output
		- Voltages between 12 and 15 generate outputs ranging from 01 to 11
		- Provides 32 times more accuracy
- Clock input to the encoder (Sampling Pulse) is so the input signal to be sampled at precise times
	- Referred to as the sample rate
	- Sample rate determines how ofted the encoder converts the analog signal to a digital signal
	- Sample rate should be at a clock speed higher than the maximum expected input frequency

# Data Selector Circuits 

- ![[Pasted image 20240310143840.png]] 
	- A-D are data
	- EN is enable
	- A1, A2 is address
	- OUT is Output
	- Multiplexing is accomplished by using synchronized clocking to change the address inputs A1 and A2 to select a given input
- ![[Pasted image 20240310152423.png]] 



# Data Distributor Circuits

- ![[Pasted image 20240310160527.png]] 
	- Choose which of several outputs will receive data from a single input
- ![[Pasted image 20240310181439.png]] 
- ![[Pasted image 20240310181643.png]] 
- ![[Pasted image 20240310185213.png]] 
	- Data distributor IC's normally have two sets of data distributor circuits with a common address input. Connecting the two sections allows designers to configure the distributor for different uses
		- Either a 3-line to 8-line decoder or 1 line demultiplexer
