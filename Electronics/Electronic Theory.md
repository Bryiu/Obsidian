# Terms

1. ==Reference_Ground== : 0 Volts. Other than the earth.

2. ==Voltage_Drop== : The decrease of electric potential (Voltage) along the path of a conductor.
	1. In this instance, in class this is used and calculated across a resistor or load

3. ==Short==: A short circuit is when there is a low resistance connection between two conductors supplying electrical power to a circuit.
	1. When this is read on a multimeter at a resistor; the resistor will read 0 Volts and the following resistors in the circuit will read at a higher voltage per Kirchhoff's Law

4. ==Open==: A break in the circuit. 
	1. On a multimeter,  this will read the maximum resistance while the other resistors will read 0 Volts because there is no flow of electrons

7. ==Change of Value==: Simply put, they are opening or shorting.
