# Terms

1. ==Reference_Ground== : 0 Volts. Other than the earth.
2. ==Kirchhoff's Current Law==: The sum of all currents into a point must equal the sum of all currents out of a point
3. ==Kirchhoff's Voltage Law==: The algebraic sum of the voltage sources and voltage drops in a loop must equal zero

# Series 

2. ==Voltage_Drop== : The decrease of electric potential (Voltage) along the path of a conductor.
	1. In this instance, in class this is used and calculated across a resistor or load

3. ==Short==: A short circuit is when there is a low to no resistance connection between two conductors supplying electrical power to a circuit.
	1. When this is read on a multimeter at a resistor; the resistor will read 0 Volts and the following resistors in the circuit will read at a higher voltage per Kirchhoff's Law

4. ==Open==: A break in the circuit. 
	1. On a multimeter,  this will read the infinite resistance while the other resistors will read 0 Volts because there is no flow of electrons

5. ==Change of Value==: Simply put, they are opening or shorting.

 # Parallel

1. ==Short== $R=0$, $I=Max$, $V=0$ 
	1. Open each branch, measuring the circuit away from the source, and close each branch to see a $0v$ reading.
