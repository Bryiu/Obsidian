# Purpose

- The function generator is used to produce accurate AC Signals
	- With a known input, circuit values can be calculated, measured, and checked
	- Signals produced
		- Sine
		- Ramp
		- Square
		- Triangle
		- Pulse
	- The symmetry of the output signal is adjustable by changing the duty cycle of a signal
		- ![[Selection_035.png]]
	- Output signal can me ==modulated== 
		- AM or FM modulation using sine, square, or triangle

# Operation

![[Selection_036.png]]

## Frequency Section

- Selects the type of signal, frequency, amplitude, DC offset, CMOS level, and duty cycle of the output
- Two output and three input connectors for internal and external signals
	- ![[Selection_037.png]]
		- The VCG/MOD input is part of the Modulation section
- The function switches select the type of signal output
	- ![[Selection_038.png]]
- The Duty cycle (Symmetry) controls change the waveform
	- ![[Pasted image 20231017105550.png]]
		- For example, a triangle wave can be changed to a ramp
		- Square can be changed to a pulse, etc
		- When the button is off, the signal is symmetrical
- The Range buttons select the maximum frequency at the output.
	- Coarse and fine controls adjust the frequency to a value between the selected range button and the button of the next lowest value.
		- Output frequency is shown on the display
- On the display, the frequency is shown in kHz when the range buttons 20k and above are used
	- Multiply the value shown on the display by 1000 Hz
- When the EXT CNTR INPUT is connected to an external circuit and the CNTR switch is set to EXT, the function generator's display show the measured frequency
- The numbers above the range buttons indicate the automatic Gate select for each range/how often the display is updated
- CNTR INT/EXT button selects which frequency is displayed, internal or external
	- INT shows the frequency of the signal produced by the function generator
	- EXT is the frequency of a signal applied to the EXT CNTR INPUT BNC
		- The signal is external and not generated by the function generator
- Output level and the -20db (attenuation) button set the amplitude of the internally generated output signal
- DC offset button and the DC offset control knob set the amount of DC voltage the signal rides on. 
	- If off, no DC Voltage is applied
- Burst and Burst width control knob set the output signals trigger phase start point.
- Output waveform is available is available at the Output BNC
	- Signals applied from the Output BNC can be used to synchronize other test equipment such as an Oscilloscope. 
- TTL/CMOS can be used as an external sync pulse for Oscilloscopes or as a variable frequency source for exercising logic circuits. 
	- fast rise time square wave that is positive with respect to ground
	- Engaging the CMOS LEVEL button applies a signal with frequency up to 2MHz and a voltage between 4 and 14 Vpp to the output jack. 


## Modulation Section

>Green section
>![[Selection_036.png]]
![[Selection_041.png]]

- When the buttons are out, the top selections are applied
>[!Note]
>AM stands for Amplitude Modulation
>FM is Frequency Modulation

- To modulate FM
	- ON and INT must be applied

- The %Modulation control adjusts the amount of modulation placed on a signal

- The VCG/MOD INPUT is used to operate the function generator as a voltage-controlled generator or as a modulation input source
	- When the Modulation is off, the VCO input is enabled
		- Function Generator frequency can be controlled by the application of an external voltage to the VCO/MOD INPUT
			- Voltage should never exceed 15VDC
	- When the Modulation is on, the VCG/MOD INPUT jack allows the application of an external modulation signal
- Modulation FM/AM switch is for the type of modulation sent to the VCG/MOD INPUT jack. 
	- ON and EXT must be enabled for external modulation
## Sweep Section
>[!Note]
>For the Sweep section to be used, the Sweep must be selected to INT and the Frequency must be fully CCW

![[Selection_042.png]]

- The START and any RANGE buttons are used together to select the start frequency of the sweep
	- Once the start frequency has been selected, the Sweep RUN/SET button is pushed in (SET)
- The STOP control and any of the range buttons select stopping frequency of the sweep operation.
	- To select the frequency where you want the sweep to stop, first select STOP
- RUN/SET to sweep from the start frequency to stop frequency
