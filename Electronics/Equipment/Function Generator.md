# Purpose

- The function generator is used to produce accurate AC Signals
	- With a known input, circuit values can be calculated, measured, and checked
	- Signals produced
		- Sine
		- Ramp
		- Square
		- Triangle
		- Pulse
	- The symmetry of the output signal is adjustable by changing the duty cycle of a signal
