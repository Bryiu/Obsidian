# Inductor
- The inductor is a component that has the ability to concentrate a magnetic field
- Represented by the letter ==L==
- Also known as a choke or a coil
- Constructed by winding wire around a core
- More current = more magnetic field; Less current = less magnetism
- ==Voltage== induced in the inductor is opposite to the voltage applied and opposes the changing current
- If the ==current== is constant, no voltage is induced into the coil of the inductor
- Used to generate voltage when "Cut" by magnetic flux
- The ==Henry== is the basic unit of inductance
	- The measurement of an inductors ability to concentrate a magnetic field
- Factors determining inductance are
	- Number of turns of wire on a coil
		- More turns, more inductance
	- Distance between windings
		- Shorter inductors have more flux density than larger ones
	- Cross sectional area of core
		- The greater cross section area, the greater the inductance
	- Permeability of core
		- The greater ease of magnetism, the greater the inductance


## Inductor in a DC circuit

- Induced voltage opposes the increasing current flow and total circuit remains at 0A

![[Selection_044.png]]

- As induced voltage decreases and total circuit current increases

- When the magnetic field reaches a steady state, no voltage is induced and total current is maximum

>[!Notice]
>Current is non-linear

- Once current has reached its maximum, the inductor acts like a short

- When the switch is opened it decreases current causing the magnetic field to contract in the inductor

- A contracting magnetic field induces a voltage in the inductor, which has the same polarity as the applied voltage

![[Selection_047.png]]

- The induced voltage opposes the decreasing current, and the total circuit current remains at maximum

![[Selection_048.png]]

- As induced voltage decreases total circuit current decreases
	- When the magnetic field is gone, no voltage is induced, and total circuit current is zero

## Inductor in an AC circuit

- If an AC voltage is applied to an inductor, the current is constantly changing, and the inductor is constantly opposing circuit current.
