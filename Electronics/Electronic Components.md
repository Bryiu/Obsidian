# Inductor
- The inductor is a component that has the ability to concentrate a magnetic field
- Represented by the letter ==L==
- Also known as a choke or a coil
- Constructed by winding wire around a core
- More current = more magnetic field; Less current = less magnetism
- ==Voltage== induced in the inductor is opposite to the voltage applied and opposes the changing current
- If the ==current== is constant, no voltage is induced into the coil of the inductor
