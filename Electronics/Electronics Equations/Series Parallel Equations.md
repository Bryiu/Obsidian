# Series Parallel
## Resistance
Calculate the Parallel circuit first with $R_t=\frac {R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}$ then add that to the series circuit with $R_t+R_{series-total}$

## Voltage 

Determining $V_o$ or $V_{out}$ using the ratio method

$\frac {V_{in}}{V_{out}} = \frac {R_{total}}{R_{out}}$

### Voltage drops
Determining voltage drops
1. Find total resistance
2. Calculate total current
3. Calculate voltage drops

## Percent Regulation

Percent Regulation is the variation between an unloaded $V_o$ and a loaded $V_{out}$ 
![[Selection_003.png]]

$$Percent\,Regulation=100*\frac{(V_o-V_{out})}{V_{out}}$$

>A 50% Regulation is poor and a 1% is good
