# Intro

- Diodes belong to a group of components called Solid-State devices
- The purpose of a diode is to allow current in one direction and stop current in another
	- Like a check valve

- The arrow represents the positive side
	- aka Anode (A)
- The bar represents the negative side
	- aka the Cathode (K)
- The ==Zener Diode== are designed to regulate voltage

- ==Rectifiers== are used to convert AC voltage to pulsating DC
- ==Limiters== are useful in signal shaping
	- Remove signal voltages above or below a specific level
- ==Clampers== add a DC voltage to the input signal
