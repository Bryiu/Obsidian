# Intro

- Transistors are used as:
	- Amplifiers
	- Oscillators
	- Electronic switches
	
 - NPN

- ==Emitter== is heavily doped; to have a large number of current carriers
	- N-Type Electrons
	- P-Type Protons
- ==Base== is lightly doped; allows current carriers to pass from ==Emitter== to ==Collector== 
- ==Collector== is moderately doped. Collects current from base
	- The collector is the largest because it needs to dissipate the most heat

- Two types of signal applied to a transistor
	- Input
	- Bias
- Transistors transfer energy from low resistance to high resistance
