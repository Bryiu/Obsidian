# Intro

- Transistors are used as:
	- Amplifiers
	- Oscillators
	- Electronic switches
	
 - NPN

- ==Emitter== is heavily doped; to have a large number of current carriers
	- N-Type Electrons
	- P-Type Protons
- ==Base== is lightly doped; allows current carriers to pass from ==Emitter== to ==Collector== 
- ==Collector== is moderately doped. Collects current from base
	- The collector is the largest because it needs to dissipate the most heat

- Power Transistors

- Two types of signal applied to a transistor
	- Input
	- Bias
- Transistors transfer energy from low resistance to high resistance
- Too much positive bias on the base of an NPN transistor causes it to lose its amplifying ability
- Too little bias on the base will stop it conducting current

- Saturation is when the base current is above the necessary current to turn the transmitter on 
	- Collector current remains constant
	- transmitter acts as a short

- Increasing $V_C$ has very little effect on $I_C$ 
	- ![[Pasted image 20231112184343.png]] 
	- $I_e=I_b+I_c$ 
		- The ratio's of the currents are constant for each type of transistor
			- This is called alpha ( $\alpha$ ) and beta ($\beta$ ), to describe transistor operation under any condition and bias level
				- $\alpha = \frac{I_c}{I_e}$
					- $\alpha$ never exceeds 1. Normal value ranges .97 and .99
				- $\beta = \frac {I_c}{I_b}$
					- $\beta$ values are larger than 1. Normal value between 20 and 400
