# Intro

- FET's are used in place of bipolar transistors when a circuit requires extremely high input impedance 
- ![[Pasted image 20231129132157.png]] 
	- Source: Current carriers enter the FET
	- Drain: Current carriers leave the FET
	- Gate: Current carriers controlled by this element

	- The two P type materials are connected to allow only one gate input
	- The width of the N channel controls the current flow and the size of the PN junction barriers

# Operation

- ![[Pasted image 20231129141516.png]] 
	- Positive voltage applied to drain $V_{dd}$
	- Negative voltage applied to gate $V_{gg}$
		- Reverse biases PN junction
		- Increasing $V_{gg}$ ($V_{gs}$) grows size of gate, decreases current
			- When current stops flowing; this is ==cut off== 
		- Decreasing $V_{gg}$ negative gate voltage decreases PN junction barrier
			- Increases current
		- FET's are made to operate with the gate reversed biased
			- Forward bias will damage component
	- $V_{gs}$ = reverse biased voltage between gate and source
	- $I_{d}$ = Source to drain current flow

- ==*Transconductance*==: The amount of control that the input voltage has over the output current 
	- $g_m$ 
		- $g_m=\frac{I_{output}}{E_{input}}$ #formula 
	- Measured in mho or siemens
	- Opposite of resistance
	- similar to $\beta$ 
		- Values range between 1 and 10 $m$mhos 
			- ex: Means 2$m$mhos is a 1$V$ change produces a 3$m$A change in output

- ==*mho*==: Conductance; **Ohm backwards** 
- ==*siemens*==: Conductance
- FETS transfer **conductance**; Transistors transfer **resistance**
- Gate biasing does not produce a stable operating point and normally not used

- Self biasing
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129153210.png]] 
		- One Voltage source
		- $V_{dd}$ applies a positive voltage on the drain through $R_d$ 
		- $R_s$ sets up the reverse bias between gate and source
			- Gate is less positive than source
- Voltage Divider Bias
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129153449.png]] 
		- One voltage source
		- Applies a positive voltage on drain through $R_d$ 
		- $R_1,R_2$ form a fixed bias on the gate
		- $R_s$ applies self biasing
- Source Biasing
	- ![[Pasted image 20231129153640.png]] 
		- Two voltage sources
