# Hertz (Hz)
- Frequency is usually measured in Hz. 
	- Hz is measured by the second and how many cycles
		- 3 cycles per second = 3 Hz

# Induction
- Induction is the generation of AV current by changing a magnetic field (*aka flux variation*)
- If the flux variation is low, induction is low and only a small amount of current is produced 
	- If high a larger amount of current is produced
		- These represent the flux lines in a magnet
		- More flux lines create a stronger magnetic field and allow for a higher induction
- Three things are required to induce current
	- a conductor
	- a magnetic field
	- relative motion
- Non standard sine waves are waves that dont begin at $0\degree$ 

# Describing AC Voltage
- ![[Selection_017.png]]
## RMS and Average
- These values state the usable amount of voltage being produced

### Average

-  Calculated by using the sum of all angles contained in $180\degree$ 
	- The constant $0.637$ is used

## Phase Angle
- The amount by which waveforms lead or lag one another is called phase angle
	- ![[Selection_022.png]]

## Vector
- represents the magnitude and angle of a current
	- ![[Selection_023.png]]
- The phase angle of two waveforms are expressed using two vectors called Phasors
	- ![[Selection_024.png]]

# Non Sinusoidal waves
- Wave forms that are not plotted in a 360$\degree$ radius

## Harmonic frequencies 
- Harmonic frequencies are determined by multiplying the fundamental frequency times the harmonic number
	- ![[Selection_025.png]]
		- $2^{nd}$ harmonic frequency=$fundamental frequency *2$
		- $3^{rd} = fundamental frequency*3$
- When combined with the fundamental frequency non-sinusoidal wave forms are produced
	- The square wave is developed using only odd harmonics
	- Adding 3rd harmonic
		- ![[Selection_026.png]]
	- Adding 5th harmonic
		- ![[Selection_027.png]]
## AC Square Wave
- The AC square wave can be symmetrical or Asymmetrical in amplitude, to a 0V reference

# Capacitors

- Electrons accumulate on the lower plate of the capacitor
![[Selection_065.png]]
- Current does not travel through the capacitor. The dielectric blocks current
![[Selection_066.png]]
- Voltage is stored in the plates of the capacitor; even when a switch is opened or the battery is removed
- Capacitors charge rapidly at first
![[Selection_068.png]]
- Capacitors discharge through leakage in the dielectric
	- To do it manually, a circuit path must exist between the two plates
- When AC is applied to the capacitor, it changes frequency at the same frequency as the AC input voltage
	- Because the AC voltage is oscillating the effect is similar to current flowing through the capacitor, though the dielectric blocks it
		- This is why its said capacitors pass AC, but block DC

### Non-Polarized

- General purpose
- Isolates one circuit from another
- Block DC signals
- Filter unwanted AC signals to ground
- Produce wave shapes
- Inserted into a circuit without regard to polarity
- The flat line indicates the plate is connected to the low side
	- Not an indicator of polarity

### Electrolytic

- Polarity sensitive
- filters unwanted AC signals from DC power supplies
- 

### Variable
- used in transmitters and recievers

## Labels

- Shows capacitance and working voltage
	- Labels in Farad
		- One farrad is very large
		- micro and pico are common
	- Working voltage should not be exceeded
![[Pasted image 20231020130858.png]]![[Pasted image 20231020130915.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231020131048.png]]

- Farad is determined by
	- Plate size
		- the larger the plate the more capacitance
	- Distance between plates
		- The closer the plates the more capacitance
	- Dielectric material
		- The higher dielectric value, the greater capacitance
