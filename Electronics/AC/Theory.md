# Hertz (Hz)
- Frequency is usually measured in Hz. 
	- Hz is measured by the second and how many cycles
		- 3 cycles per second = 3 Hz

# Induction
- Induction is the generation of AV current by changing a magnetic field (*aka flux variation*)
- If the flux variation is low, induction is low and only a small amount of current is produced 
	- If high a larger amount of current is produced
		- ![[Selection_016.png]]
			- These represent the flux lines in a magnet
			- More flux lines create a stronger magnetic field and allow for a higher induction
- Three things are required to induce current
	- a conductor
	- a magnetic field
	- relative motion
- Non standard sine waves are waves that dont begin at $0\degree$ 

# Describing AC Voltage
- ![[Selection_017.png]]
## RMS and Average
- These values state the usable amount of voltage being produced

### Average

-  Calculated by using the sum of all angles contained in $180\degree$ 
	- The constant $0.637$ is used

## Phase Angle
- The amount by which waveforms lead or lag one another is called phase angle
	- ![[Selection_022.png]]

## Vector
- represents the magnitude and angle of a current
	- ![[Selection_023.png]]
- The phase angle of two waveforms are expressed using two vectors called Phasors
	- ![[Selection_024.png]]

# Non Sinusoidal waves
- Wave forms that are not plotted in a 360$\degree$ radius

## Harmonic frequencies 
- Harmonic frequencies are determined by multiplying the fundamental frequency times the harmonic number
	- ![[Selection_025.png]]
		- $2^{nd}$ harmonic frequency=$fundamental frequency *2$
		- $3^{rd} = fundamental frequency*3$
- When combined with the fundamental frequency non-sinusoidal wave forms are produced
	- The square wave is developed using only odd harmonics
	- Adding 3rd harmonic
		- ![[Selection_026.png]]
	- Adding 5th harmonic
