# Hertz (Hz)
- Frequency is usually measured in Hz. 
	- Hz is measured by the second and how many cycles
		- 3 cycles per second = 3 Hz

# Induction
- Induction is the generation of AV current by changing a magnetic field (*aka flux variation*)
- If the flux variation is low, induction is low and only a small amount of current is produced 
	- If high a larger amount of current is produced
		- ![[Selection_016.png]]
			- These represent the flux lines in a magnet
			- More flux lines create a stronger magnetic field and allow for a higher induction
- Three things are required to induce current
	- a conductor
	- a magnetic field
	- relative motion
