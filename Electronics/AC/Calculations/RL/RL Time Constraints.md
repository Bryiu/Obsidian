- The more inductive the current, the longer the time constant
- $R_L$ circtuits graph current, $R_C$ graph voltage

# Calculating Time Constant

- $T=\frac{L}{R}$
	- T is time in seconds
	- L is inductance in henries
	- R is Resistance in ohms
- $I=\frac {V_A}{R}$

## Voltage drop at a TC

- $V_{R_1}=I_G*R_1$
	- $I_G$ is current growth after time constant
- subtract applied voltage from the resistor to find voltage drop
