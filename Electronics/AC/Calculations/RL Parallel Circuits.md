- Similar to Parallel resistor circuits
	- Need to consider phase relationship of the resistor and inductor
- Inductive resistance is the opposition to current flow

# Converting from $V_{pp}$ To $V_{rms}$
- $V_{pk}=\frac{V_{pp}}{2}$
- $V_{rms}=V_{pk}*0.707$
- $I_{pk}=\frac{I_{pp}}{2}$
- $I_{rms}=I_{pk}*0.707$

# Intro
- Total inductance of a parallel circuit is always less than the smallest inductor
- Placing inductors in parallel has the same effect as increasing the area that contains the winding
	- The more area, the less flux density

# Finding total inductance

- $L_T=\frac {L_1*L_2}{L_1+L_2}$
- $X_L=2 \pi f L$
	- Measured in ohms
