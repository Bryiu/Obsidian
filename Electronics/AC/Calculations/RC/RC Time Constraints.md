- Used to analyze the Capacitor's cycles

- Important in non-sinusoidal circuits to change the shape of input waveforms
- $R_C$ circuit represents Voltage
	- Charges and discharges
- $R_L$ circuit represents Current
	- energizes and de-energizes
- $R_C$ time constants are the time it takes capacitors to charge or discharge
	- If $T_{C_1}$ = 1 second then $T_{C_2} = 2 seconds, etc

	- It takes five time constants for a capacitor to charge fully
		- ![[Pasted image 20231025130236.png]] 
			- The more capacitance, the longer to charge
			- The more resistance, the longer the charge
	- 5 time constants to discharge fully (Less than 1%)

		- resistance and capacitance also slow down charge time

# Calculating Charge or Discharge Time

- $\% V_A*V_A= charge$
- $T_{C_1}=R*C$
