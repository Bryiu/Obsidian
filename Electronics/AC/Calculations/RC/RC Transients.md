- Occurs when the voltage across a capacitor changes
- Transient - relation between change in current and change in voltage
	- No change in applied voltage, no current
- DC charge rate
	- $T=R*C$
- When Time Constants are short relative to the frequency it produces pulses in currents
- When time constants are long relative to the frequency it doesnt allow the capacitor to charge fully, having small amounts of current as a product
- As frequency decreases, the voltage across the capacitor equals $V_A$
- As frequency or time constant increases, the voltage across the capacitor decreases
- ==This is the principal of capacitive reactance==
	- Capacitive reactance only applies to sine waves
	- High capacitive reactance produces a short time constant
	- Low capacitive reactance produces a long time constant

# Coupling Capacitors

- Because the capacitor stays at the same charge when an AC signal rides a DC signal, the voltage drop across a capacitor will be AC for the changes presented in the AC wave
- For coupling capacitors to work, a long time constant is required so the capacitor has little time to charge and discharge with input variations
	- A short time constant would cause capacitive reactance, dropping some of the AC signal
