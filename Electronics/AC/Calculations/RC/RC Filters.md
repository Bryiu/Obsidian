- Blocks certain frequencies and pass others
- As frequency increases, capacitive reactance decreases 
# High pass

	- Low frequency
	- High $X_C$
		- Input signal is dropped across the capacitor and does not reach the output

	- High Frequency
	- Low $X_C$
		- Low $X_C$ does not drop very much voltage, most signal reaches the output

# Low pass

-  ![[Pasted image 20231023112452.png]] 
- At low frequencies, $C_1$ has a large capacitive reactance
- Low frequency
	- High $X_C$
	- Max output
	- Higher frequencies cause a higher drop across $R_1$ preventing it from reaching the output
