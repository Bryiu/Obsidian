# Relay

- Used for applying power to circuits or controlling signal flow
- Magnetically operated switches
- Schematic symbols
	-  ![[Pasted image 20231029144232.png]] 
		- magnetic core and coil are indicated by a zigzag line or a core with one loop wire
		- reference designator for relays is (K)
		- schematics show relays in the de-energized condition touching the normally closed contact
	- Latched relays use one set of contacts to keep the relay energized, even after the energized voltage has been removed
		- used to POWER UP electronic systems
	- Power relays have a contact with no power
	- Control relays have two power outputs
	- Time delay relays operate after a set amount of time elapses from when the voltage is applied

# Solenoids

- Relays have a stationary core
- Solenoids have a movable core
