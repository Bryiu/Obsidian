# Frequency
- When finding the frequency on the oscilliscope, multiply the SEC/DIV setting by the number of divisions
	- ex in WISC $.2ms*9(divisions)=0.0018$
- $T(period)=\frac {1}{f (frequency)}$
	- *==Period*== is determined by the time taken to complete once cycle of the sine wave
	- ==*Frequency*== is calculated by the cycles per second
- $f = \frac {1}{0.0018}=555 Hz$
