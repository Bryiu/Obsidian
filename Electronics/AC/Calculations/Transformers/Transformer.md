# Intro

- $Power= V*I$

- Transformers increase or decrease voltage, depending on the requirements of the load
- Transformers isolate one circuit from another 
- Their purpose is to transfer power.
	- *Power in = Power out*
	- Change voltage and current levels
- Transformer input is Primary
	- Output is secondary

	- In blue are Iron cores. Mostly used in power supply's
		- They use thin sheets of iron coated in lacquer to reduce eddy current losses
			- Overheating is also a cause of reducing eddy currents
	- $T_2$ and $T_3$ are air core
		- Used in radio circuits
- $V_s$ depends on $V_p,N_p,\, and\, N_s$ 
	- $V_s=secondary \,voltage$
	- $V_p=primary \, voltage$
	- $N_p=$ number of turns in primary
	- $N_s=$ number of turns in secondary
- Assuming no losses
	- if $N_s=N_p$ , then $V_s=V_p$ 
	- if $N_s<N_p$ , $V_s<V_p$ 
		- the transformer steps down the voltage.
	- if $N_s>N_p$  , $V_s>V_p$ 
		- Steps up the voltage
- They do not change the frequency of the applied voltage
- They can invert the phase
	- This is because the coils are wound in opposite direction.

		- The dots indicate positive

# Turns Ratio

- Number of turns in the primary to the secondary
	- $Turns \, ratio= \frac {N_p}{N_s}=N_p:N_s$


# Voltage

- $Voltage \, ratio= \frac {V_p}{V_s}=V_p:V_s$
- $P_p=P_{S_1}+P_{S_2}$
- $P_p=\frac {I_p}{V_p}$


# Current

>[!Note]
>Current is inverse of both voltage and the turns ratio in transformers



- $I_s=\frac {V_s}{R_{\, of \, the \, circuit}}$
- $I_p=\frac {P_p}{V_p}$
- $I_p=\frac {P_s}{V_p}$
- $I_p=\frac {I_s*V_s}{V_p}$
