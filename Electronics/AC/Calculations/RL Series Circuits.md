- All calculations are based *in this lesson* are $V_{pp}$
- Inductance describes the induced voltage produced by a changing magnetic field
	- Greater inductance = Greater induced voltage
- AC voltage causes the magnetic field to expand and contract 
	- produces a voltage that opposes current flow
- 

# Changing $V_{pp}$ to RMS
- $V_{pk}=\frac{V_{pp}}{2}$
- $V_{rms}=V_{pk}*0.707$
- $I_{pk}=\frac{I_{pp}}{2}$
- $I_{rms}=I_{pk}*0.707$

==Total Inductance = ($L_T$)==

# Calculating Total Inductance
- $L_T=L_1+L_2+L_3+L_4...$

# Inductive Reactance
- Represented by $X_L$
	- Measured in ohms
		- Represents the amount of opposition to current flow in the circuit
- Caused by the inductance and frequency of the circuit
