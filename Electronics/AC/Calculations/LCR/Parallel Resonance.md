	- Circuits without parallel resistance
	- effect on circuit values is the same
		- ![[Pasted image 20231026155650.png]] 
			- There is current flowing in each branch, they are just 180$\degree$ out of phase
			- In effect, energy is passed from the capacitor to the inductor and back again
				- ![[Pasted image 20231026155910.png]] 
					- As the capacitor discharges, a current passes through the inductor, creating a magnetic field
					- When the capacitor stops discharging, the magnetic field collapses, producing current flow
						- The capacitor charges in the opposite direction
						- This is called ==THE FLYWHEEL EFFECT== 
							- Used to generate oscillators
