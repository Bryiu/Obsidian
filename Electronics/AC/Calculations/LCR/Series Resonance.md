# Calculating Resonance

- Resonance = when $X_C = X_L$
	- Series LC or series LCR
	- Frequency causes them to be equal
	- Labeled $f_r$
		- ![[Pasted image 20231026145753.png]] 
- Circuit charachteristics change with frequency
	- Impedence
	- Current
	- Voltage


- $f_r=\frac {1}{2 \pi \sqrt{LC}}$

# Calculating Impedence

>[!Note]
> Below resonance -> Increases
> At resonance        -> Minimum
> Above resonance -> Increases

>[!Important]
>Total Impedance equals Resistance

- Example
	- Below Resonance

	- At Resonance
	- ![[Pasted image 20231026151306.png]] 
		- ![[Pasted image 20231026151403.png]] 
	- Above resonance

- $Z_T=R$

# Calculating Current

>[!Note]
>Below resonance -> Decreases
>At resonance        -> Maximum
>Above resonance -> Decreases

- $I_T=\frac{V_A}{Z_T}$

# Calculating Voltage

 >[!Note]
 >Below resonance      -> Decreases
 >At resonance             -> Maximum
 >Above resonance      -> Decreases

- $V_R= I_T*R_1$

# Magnification

- At resonance, if the value of $R$ is a lot less than the values of $X_L$ and $X_C$ the voltage across the reactive components can be much larger than the applied voltage
